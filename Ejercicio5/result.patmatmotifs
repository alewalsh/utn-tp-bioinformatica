# * EGF-like domain signatures and profile *
# ******************************************
# 
# A sequence of  about thirty  to forty amino-acid  residues  long found in  the
# sequence of  epidermal  growth  factor  (EGF)  has been  shown  [1 to 6] to be
# present, in  a more or less conserved form, in a large number of other, mostly
# animal  proteins.  EGF  is  a  polypeptide  of about 50 amino acids with three
# internal  disulfide  bridges.  It  first  binds with high affinity to specific
# cell-surface receptors and then induces their dimerization, which is essential
# for  activating  the  tyrosine  kinase  in  the  receptor  cytoplasmic domain,
# initiating  a  signal  transduction  that  results  in  DNA synthesis and cell
# proliferation.
# 
# A  common  feature  of  all  EGF-like  domains  is  that they are found in the
# extracellular  domain  of  membrane-bound  proteins or in proteins known to be
# secreted (exception: prostaglandin G/H synthase). The EGF-like domain includes
# six cysteine residues which have been shown to be involved in disulfide bonds.
# The  structure  of several EGF-like domains has been solved. The fold consists
# of   two-stranded  beta-sheet  followed  by  a  loop  to  a  C-terminal  short
# two-stranded sheet (see <PDB:1EGF). Subdomains between the conserved cysteines
# strongly  vary in length as shown in the following schematic representation of
# the EGF-like domain:

# The region between the 5th and 6th cysteine contains two conserved glycines of
# which at  least  one  is  present  in  most  EGF-like  domains. We created two
# patterns for  this  domain,  each  including one of these C-terminal conserved
# glycine residues. The profile we developed covers the whole domain.
# 
# -Consensus pattern: C-x-C-x(2)-{V}-x(2)-G-{C}-x-C
#                     [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
# -Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
#  but not  those  that  have very long or very short regions between the last 3
#  conserved cysteines of their EGF-like domain(s).
# -Other sequence(s)  detected  in  Swiss-Prot:  87 proteins, of which 27 can be
#  considered as possible candidates.
# 
# -Consensus pattern: C-x-C-x(2)-[GP]-[FYW]-x(4,8)-C
#                     [The 3 C's are involved in disulfide bonds]
# -Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the pattern: ALL.
#  but not  those  that  have very long or very short regions between the last 3
#  conserved cysteines of their EGF-like domain(s).
# -Other sequence(s)  detected  in  Swiss-Prot:  83 proteins, of which 49 can be
#  considered as possible candidates.
# 
# -Sequences known to belong to this class detected by the profile: ALL.
# -Other sequence(s) detected in Swiss-Prot: NONE.
# 
# -Note: The  beta chain of the integrin family of proteins contains 2 cysteine-
#  rich repeats  which were said to be dissimilar with the EGF pattern [7].
# -Note: Laminin  EGF-like repeats (see <PDOC00961>) are longer than the average
#  EGF module  and  contain  a further disulfide bond C-terminal of the EGF-like
#  region. Perlecan  and  agrin  contain  both EGF-like domains and laminin-type
#  EGF-like domains.
# -Note: The  pattern do not detect all of the repeats of proteins with multiple
#  EGF-like repeats.
# -Note: See <PDOC00913> for an entry describing specifically the subset of EGF-
#  like domains that bind calcium.

# ************************
# 
# Two different  types  of thiolase [1,2,3] are found  both in eukaryotes and in
# prokaryotes: acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (EC 2.3.1.9) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase
# (EC 2.3.1.16).  3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (also called thiolase I)  has  a broad
# chain-length specificity  for  its substrates and is involved   in degradative
# pathways  such as  fatty acid  beta-oxidation.  Acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase (also
# called thiolase  II)  is  specific  for  the  thiolysis of acetoacetyl-CoA and
# involved in biosynthetic pathways such  as poly beta-hydroxybutyrate synthesis
# or steroid biogenesis.
# 
# In eukaryotes, there are two forms of 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase: one  located in
# the mitochondrion and the other in peroxisomes.
# 
# There are two conserved cysteine residues important for thiolase activity. The
# first located  in  the  N-terminal  section  of the enzymes is involved in the
# formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate; the second located at the C-terminal
# extremity is   the   active   site  base  involved  in  deprotonation  in  the
# condensation reaction.
# 
# Mammalian nonspecific  lipid-transfer  protein (nsL-TP)  (also known as sterol
# carrier protein 2) is a protein which seems  to exist  in two different forms:
# a 14  Kd  protein  (SCP-2)  and  a larger 58 Kd protein (SCP-x). The former is
# found in the cytoplasm or the mitochondria and is involved in lipid transport;
# the latter is found in peroxisomes.  The C-terminal part of SCP-x is identical
# to SCP-2  while  the  N-terminal  portion is evolutionary related to thiolases
# [4].
# 
# We developed  three  signature  patterns  for  this family of proteins, two of
# which are  based  on  the regions around the biologically important cysteines.
# The third  is  based  on  a  highly conserved region in the C-terminal part of
# these proteins.

# 
# Defensins [1   to   5],  also  known  as  alpha-defensins,  are  a  family  of
# structurally related  cysteine-rich peptides active against many Gram-negative
# and Gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and enveloped  viruses.  Some defensins are
# also called corticostatins (CS) because they inhibit  corticotropin-stimulated
# corticosteroid production.  Defensins kills cells by forming voltage-regulated
# multimeric channels   in   the   susceptible  cell's  membrane.  They  play  a
# significant role in innate immunity  to  infection and neoplasia. The peptides
# known to belong to this family are listed below.
# 
#  - Rabbit defensins and  corticostatins:  CS-I (NP-3A),  CS-II (NP-3B), CS-III
#    (MCP-1), CS-IV (MCP-2), NP-4, and NP-5.
#  - Guinea-pig neutrophil defensin (GPNP).
#  - Human neutrophil defensins 1 to 4 and intestinal defensins 5 and 6.
#  - Mouse small bowel cryptdins 1 to 5.
#  - Rat NP-1 to NP-4.
# 
# All these peptides range in length from 29 to 35 amino acids.  There are seven
# invariant  residues,  including   six  cysteines  all  involved  in intrachain
# disulfide bonds.     A schematic  representation of peptides from the defensin

#    VWFB domains,  2 VWFC  domains,  an X domain and a C-terminal cystine knot.
#    There might be a third VWFC domain within the type B domain region [2].
#  - Silk  moth hemocytin, an humoral lectin which is involved in a self-defence

#  - Several  vertebrate heavily glycosylated  mucins. Human mucin 2 is secreted
#    by the  epithelia  of  different  mucus membrane-containing organs. It is a
#    highly polymorphic  multidomain molecule. Rat intestinal mucin-like peptide
#    coats the  epithelia  of  the  intestines.  Both  proteins  share a modular

#    contain the  VWFC  domain  are  human tracheobronchial mucin (MUC5), bovine
#    submaxillary mucin-like protein, human and pig apomucin.
#  - Cef-10/cyr61/CTGF/fisp-12/nov  protein  family.  The members of this family
#    are structurally  related  to   insulin-like growth factor binding proteins

#    They contain an insulin-like growth factor-binding domain, a VWFC repeat, a
#    thrombospondin type 1 repeat (Tsp1) and a C-terminal cystine knot.
#  - Vertebrate  thrombospondins  1  and 2. These adhesive glycoproteins mediate
#    cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions. They are composed of a common
#    thrombospondin N-terminal  domain  (TspN),  a VWFC domain, three Tsp type 1
#    repeats (Tsp1), 3 to 4 EGF-like domains and 7 calcium-binding Tsp3 repeats.
#  - Vertebrate propeptides of fibrillar collagens alpha 1(I, II & III) and 2(V)
#    chains that  contain  an  N-terminal  VWFC  domain, a collagenous region of
#    about 1000  amino  acids  and  a  C-terminus  common to fibrillar collagens
#    (COLFI domain).
#  - Vertebrate  integral  membrane  protein  DGCR2/IDD,  a  potential  adhesion
#    receptor with  1  LDL-receptor  class  A domain (see <PDOC00929>), a C-type
#    lectin and a VWFC domain.
#  - Chordin, a Xenopus developmental protein that contains four VWFC domains.
# 
# Of these proteins, the best characterized one is the von Willebrand factor for
# which the duplicated VWFC domain is thought to participate in oligomerization,
# but not in  the initial dimerization step [4].  The presence of this region in
# other  complex-forming  proteins leads to the assumption  that the VWFC domain
# might be involved in forming larger protein complexes [1,2].
# 
# The profile we developed covers the entire VWFC domain.
